# Matrix_Multiplication_DGEMM

DGEMM stands for Double-precision General Matrix Multiply. It is a routine in the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) that performs one of the matrix-matrix operations.

Please provide the size "n" of the square matrices A and B.
Initialize matrix A with n x n elements.
Initialize matrix B with n x n elements.
Perform the DGEMM operation to obtain matrix C.


You can run the Makefile using the command "make" in the Unix/Linux terminal, or you can directly execute the program by typing "./degmm" in the terminal.
In case of using the Makefile to compile the main.c, remember to change the SRC and OBJ directories path in the Makefile !
